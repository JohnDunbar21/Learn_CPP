# Errors

## Compile-Time Errors

There are two types of compile-time errors:
- **Syntax errors**: errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
- **Type errors**: errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.

## Link-Time Errors

A link-time error occurs when code compiles but cannot find some function or library that it needs.

## Run-Time Errors

A run-time errors occurs whent he code compiles and runs, but at some point during its execution, throws an error.

## Logic Errors

Logic errors occur when the program doesn't have any fatal errors, but does not run according to its intended purpose. This is usually a simple fix, but can be quite hard to locate in large enterprise code.
